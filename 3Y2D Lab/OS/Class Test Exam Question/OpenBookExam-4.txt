1. Say that the main thread of a process, P, has four local variables, a, b, c, and d
   and a global variable, S. P assigns a = 5; b = 6; c = 3; d = 2; and S = 0. 
   P has three threads T1, T2, and T3, where three threads does the folowing three tasks:
   T1: E = E + a + b
   T2: E = E + b / c
   T3: E = E + d
   
   Say, the main thread print the value of E before exiting, what will be the otput if:
   a) there is only one physical processor with one logical processor and if the main thread wait for  
      all of its threads to finish their tasks?
   b) there is only one physical processor with one logical processor and if the main thread does not   
      wait for any of its threads to finish their tasks?
   c) there are four physical processors having one logical processor in each physical processor and    
      if the main thread wait for all of its threads to finish their tasks?
      
2. Is there any difference between a thread and a child process? What?

3. In a server-client model, what is better: prepare a  separate thread or a child process for handling 
   a client? Why?
   
4. Why do recent systems support logical processors?
